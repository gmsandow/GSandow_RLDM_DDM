# Read me!

This repository contains the code for the final assignment of the course Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making: Computational and Neural Mechanisms, as well as the helper functions and data set that were provided by the course coordinators.

### Model Fitting
The model fitting code can be found in two file formats (.Rmd and .pdf) under the name **GSandow_Fit_DDM**.

### Data Simulation
The data simulation code is included, but not part of my final assignment. It can also be found in two file formats (.Rmd and .pdf) under the name **GSandow_Simulation_DDM**.
